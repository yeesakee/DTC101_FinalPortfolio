    Curation Project — Reflection 
I decided to explore the cultural impact phones have had on our society due to their 
extraordinary evolution. It is fascinating from a technological standpoint and from a cultural 
standpoint to analyze how we have transformed the way we communicate and interact with 
each other. The process of finding information and images for my project was not difficult as it is 
very well documented due to how popular phones are. I was able to find Wikimedia, which is a 
website that provides images that are either creative commons materials or public domain. 
Before I was able to find this website I had a very difficult time finding any images of the specific 
phones I was looking for. I was also not able to find any articles that were creative commons 
materials or public domain materials that spoke specifically about the cultural impact of phones. 
It made me realize just how rare these materials are, although rightfully so as the owner of 
these images and articles deserve recognition and value for their work. 
My project focuses on the different functionalities that were the main focus of phones 
during a given time period and how it transformed the way we communicate. I wanted to avoid 
the narrative of "newer is better" or "older is better" and highlight how each technological 
advancement we made to phones had an impact on society. Phones started with the focus of 
connecting people over long distances. For the first time, it allowed for instant communication 
instead of waiting for the next time you meet them. It provided convenience, and importantly it 
strengthened our relationships with one another and brought us closer as a community. Each 
technological advancement still heavily relied on the notion of bringing people together. For 
example, TikTok although seen as more of an entertainment app, creates communities that 
allow people to share important thoughts and content with one another. I often see content that 
advocates for minorities or speaks up against discrimination in our communities. Although 
phones are now drastically different from a technological aspect with many more functionalities 
than ever before, communication and connection is ultimately what drive people to continue to 
rely heavily on their phones.
